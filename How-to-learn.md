## Become a squirrel (Smoljames)
Squirrels accumulate massive amounts of resources in a tree.  They could not keep enough resources in their stomach to sustain them for the winter. 

We need to create a "tree" for our resources. **artificial working memory**

It is impossible to retain all the valuable information you come across in your active working memory. Especially within the realm of programming, networking, cybersecurity, etc. 

A good artificial working memory contains high-value information that is effectively indexed and cataloged for later reference. Even if you forget the thing, being familiar enough with the topic to know you encountered it and have stored the info somewhere, and know where to find it, is essentially the same as remembering the thing. 

As we retrieve info from our artificial working memory and utilize it, it might move from our artificial working memory to our active working memory. 

### How to create your tree
Use github to create repositories of notes, tutorials, snippets of code, that can later be accessed when needed.
